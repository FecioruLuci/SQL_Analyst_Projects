## 👥 Customer Segmentation

1. Grouped customers into three segments based on **spending behavior and lifespan**:  

   - **VIP:** ≥12 months of history and total spending > $5000  
   - **Regular:** ≥12 months of history and total spending < $5000  
   - **New:** lifespan < 12 months  

2. Computed additional customer metrics:  

   - **Age group:** `YOUNG (<25)`, `ADULT (25–40)`, `OLD (>40)`  
   - **Total orders and total sales per customer**  
   - **Total quantity purchased**  
   - **Lifespan in months** (time between first and last order)  
   - **Recency:** months since last order  
   - **Average order value** and **average monthly spend**
